            <li>Sorghum samples were collected from 20 days-old leaves, inflorescences before flower emergence, inflorescence at flower emergence, pistils and anthers while anthesis, seeds 5 and 10 days after pollination and embryos and endosperms from seeds 25 days after pollination. Samples were subjected to RNAseq analysis.

            <li>The criteria for the identification of a tissue-enriched gene was a normalized expression in a particular tissue above the 175% of average expression value accross all tissues.</li>
    
            <li>Genes with no expression were removed.</li>

            <li>TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher's test in its enrichment function.</li>
