        <li>Tomato fruits spanning all ripening process from anthesis to comprete ripening were collected and hand-dissected or lasser-microdissected. The different tissues, at different develepment stages and different zones (stem, equatorial and stylar regions) were submited for RNAseq analysis.</li>

        <li>The criteria for the identification of a sample-enriched gene was a normalized expression in a particular sample above the 175% of average normalized expression value accross all samples.</li>
        
        <li>SVG image only represents equatorial regions of tomato fruit.</li>

        <li>TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher's test in its enrichment function.</li>
