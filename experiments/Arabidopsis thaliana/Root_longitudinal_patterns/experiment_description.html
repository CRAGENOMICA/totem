    <strong><em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> root longitudinal patterns.</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Available gene ID format for this experiment: AT*G*****</li>
    
        <li>Data from <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5851/801.long">Brady et al., 2007.</a></li>
    
        <li>Arabidopsis primary root was cut apart in 12 (unequal) sections, from columella until differentiated zone. Gene expression for
            each section quantified with ATH1 Affimetrix microarrays.</li>
    
        <li>The criteria for the identification of a section-enriched gene was an expression in a particular section above the 175% of average 
            expression value accross all sections (from the 50% most variable probes in the array).</li>

        <li>TOTEM browser uses a two-tailed Fisher's test in its enrichment function.</li>
    </ul>
