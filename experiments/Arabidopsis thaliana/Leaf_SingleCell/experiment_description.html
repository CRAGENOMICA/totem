    <strong><em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> wild-type leaves with single cell RNAseq resolution.</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Available gene ID format for this experiment: AT*G*****</li>
    
        <li>Leaf scRNAseq atlas with 11413 cells constructed by integrating 
            <a href="https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/33/3/511/6067477">Kim et al., 2021</a> and

        <li>Tissue identification with experimentally-tested marker genes and pseudotime analysis reveals 34 different cell populations in different developmental stages in the Arabidopsis leaves.</li>
    
        <li>A gene is cell population-enriched if its expression is at least the double comparing the rest of the cell populations, if it is expressed in at least the 25% of all cells in the atlas, 
            if its p-value is less than 0,01 and if its log2 fold change is higher than 0.58. </li>
